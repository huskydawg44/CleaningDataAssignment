# CleaningDataAssignment
Getting and Cleaning Data Week 4 Final Project

I wrote one script file called run_analysis.R
This file contains code that:
1) Loads the different data files needed to perform the analysis
2) Marks columns with Readable names
3) Selects from the data set only the columns pertaining to mean and std dev.
4) Cleans up the names of the data columns
5) Merges the different data frames together into a single tidy data frame
6) Summarizes and creates a tidy data frame that is the mean of the data by user and activity.

CodeBook.md contains a list of all variables used.
